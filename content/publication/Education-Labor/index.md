abstract = "In a rigid labor market unable to absorb the expanding university educated labor force under the free public education policy, the Tunisian government relies heavily on expensive active labor market policy tools to aid university graduates as they transition from school to work. In this paper, I examine the disconnect between higher education and employment in Tunisia. Using a regression discontinuity design based on discontinuities in university admission scores, I compare two groups of university students who chose similar fields but different study tracks where one is perceived as better and is preferred to the second by all the students in the study, thus creating a clear sorting in ability. I find that going to a more preferred university program, increases the likelihood of using government job search services by 11 percent but does not cost more in average subsidies paid. As one would expect that the least able group is more likely to struggle to find a first job independently and to use the offered services, this finding suggests that the inadequacy of the labor market leads the most able group to take longer to find a first job."
