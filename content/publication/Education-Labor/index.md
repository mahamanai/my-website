I examine how university graduates use public employment services in Tunisia in terms of registration, internship programs participation and subsidies received. 

In a context where students submit rank-ordered lists to indicate their preferences, I look at students in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) who pursue their studies in two different tracks with one being more selective in terms of peer quality and prestige. The selective track ranks high and attracts students with high admission scores, whereas the non-selective track ranks lower and has students with lower admissions scores. 

Using a regression discontinuity design based on discontinuities in university admission scores, I find that getting into the selective track increases the likelihood of registration at the public employment agency after five years of university studies by 11 percentage points. 

Additional suggestive evidence shows that attending the selective track decreases the participation in the active labor market policy internship programs by 15 percentage points but does not cost more in average subsidies paid relative to the regular track. This suggests that the labor market is unable to quickly absorb the most able university graduates.
