abstract = "During the Great Recession, the United States introduced a temporary program that allows to extend the duration of unemployment insurance. In this paper, we ask if these extensions contributed to better health or perception of one’s health. To answer this question, we differentiate between two health measures: self-reported general health which is highly correlated with the real health status and mental health which is a subjective and retrospective evaluation of one’s mental health. On the one hand, estimates from two different models suggest that extending benefits only enhance mental health but this result is mostly mitigated by low precision. On the other hand, cutting all income assistance at once at the expiry of the program affected negatively the health of long term unemployed by 14%. In this analysis, we distinguish between two types of extensions in two different models. The first model consists on a regression discountinuity approach where time is the running variable and the treatment corresponds to the introduction/expiry of the extended benefits policy in all United States. Whilst the second model, a difference-in-differences framework, focuses on the effect of conditional treatment in the form of additional weeks of coverage in certain states that reach a pre-determined high level of unemployment."
