During the Great Recession, the United States introduced a temporary program that allowed to extend the duration of unemployment benefits. I ask if these extensions contributed to better health. To answer this question, I differentiate between two health measures: self-reported general health which is highly correlated with the real health status and mental health which is a subjective and retrospective evaluation of one’s mental health. 

I find that both the introduction and expiry of this program had a negative effect on the general health of long term unemployed job seekers, i.e., those looking for work for more than a year. While the negative health response to the program’s expiry is a response to a cut of benefits, the introduction only represents news on benefit extensions and since information on eligibility of the long term unemployed might have not been clear to them yet, their negative health response could be interpreted as an externality. Mental health is not affected by the introduction and expiry of the program. 

In addition, I design a strategy to assess the effects of the extensions triggered by state level unemployment. These state level changes in benefits improve mental health during August 2008 to December 2008, but not thereafter.
