abstract = "We exploit large changes in the unemployment insurance (UI) maximum duration in the United States to study the effect of having UI for a longer period on self-reported general health and number of days of bad mental health. Using two complementary approaches, a regression discontinuity design at the time of the change in potential UI duration and a fuzzy differences-in-differences approach introduced by de Chaisemartin and D’Haultfœuille (2017), we find that while the most advertised and important changes in potential UI duration have a large negative but noisy effect on the number of bad mental health days, it does not have a significant effect on self-reported general health. Since we interpret the general health measure as a health report in real time and the mental health measure as a retrospective global evaluation of one’s health, we expect larger and more important effects of UI duration on mental health compared to general health (Kahneman et al., 2006)."
