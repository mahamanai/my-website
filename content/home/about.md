# Welcome
I am an applied micro-economist in the fields of behavioral economics and labor economics. My secondary field of interest is market design. 

My research applies the economics' approach to human behavior and extends it by including psychological concepts and behavioral biases. This allows me to improve the predictive power of economic theories and to answer policy relevant questions with a focus on the labor market.

Currently, I am finishing my PhD thesis at the University of Lausanne.
